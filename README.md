# My--ToDoList--JS

Hello! This is my first big project written in javascript. 

In any case, for me this is a big project for 200 lines of js code) 
Optimization of functions leaves much to be desired, but the main thing is that everything works!
I will perfectly bring this project as I learn JavaScript.
In HTML, I tried to use the BEM methodology. 
In the plans, add a dark theme)

Thanks for watching )
